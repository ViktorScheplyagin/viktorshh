      I&apos;m a seasoned web front-end developer with a passion for crafting
      remarkable user experiences. My journey began with React and TypeScript,
      but I&apos;ve also explored back-end technologies like NestJS, Docker,
      MongoDB, and MySQL. My focus is on becoming a full-stack web developer,
      specializing in Angular and NestJS. Clean, scalable code using
      object-oriented programming and SOLID principles is my mantra. I&apos;m
      always learning and seeking the best practices to enhance my skills.
      Explore my projects and get in touch to discuss web development.
